  In the Construction industry, Concrete is one of the most used materials on projects worldwide. Depending on the project, the strength of the concrete might need to be
a certain PSI (a level of pressure) so that it can withstand loads of weight and meet the requirements of the project.

  That led me to wonder: what are the best componenets used for creating the ideal concrete strength? How much of each component should be used in the concrete mixture? 
In this project, I explore these questions by taking a look at sample concrete data within a statistical programming language called R. I will analyze the statistics and 
visualizations and try to predict concrete strength using predictive analytics techniques. Hope you enjoy the project!
